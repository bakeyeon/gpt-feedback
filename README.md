# ChatGPT UX Feedback Archive (Unofficial)

> Multilingual | STT | Prompt Behavior | QA-driven Observations

This repo collects selected user-centered reflections, bug reports, and UX notes based on my independent interaction with ChatGPT (mostly Android & Desktop, 2024–2025).  
Focus areas include:
- STT issues in Korean (loss, mismatch, no edit mode, etc.)
- Prompt ambiguity and context handling
- Multilingual behavior and UI/UX friction

⚠️ Disclaimer:  
These are **not official OpenAI documents** — they reflect **my personal observations as a QA-linguist and advanced user.**

### Why this archive?
Because user voices matter — especially multilingual ones.  
Because language is more than just accuracy — it's experience.  
And because someone had to write it down.

> “While others were experimenting, I was executing.”
> I wasn’t just a test subject — I contributed directly to the environment of the experiment itself.

This portfolio contains real-time interactions and strategic feedback provided to a leading LLM system (ChatGPT), which were later reflected in live model behavior and dialogue tone adjustments.  
My language, structure, and user experience critiques were not only heard — they were visibly adopted.

This is not just usage.  
It’s contribution.
