# AI Insights/Feedback Archive (Unofficial)

> Multilingual | STT | Prompt Behavior | QA-driven Observations | Product-minded Linguist Reports

This repo collects selected user-centered reflections, bug reports, and UX notes based on my independent interaction with AI Chatbot Platforms (mostly Android & Desktop, 2025).  
Focus areas include:
- STT issues in Korean (loss, mismatch, no edit mode, etc.)
- Prompt ambiguity and context handling
- Multilingual behavior and UI/UX friction
- Suggest new user-participatory event ideas
- Proposing a new revenue model

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:

### Why this archive?
#### **First of all, the feedback I give is my intellectual property.**
Additionally, user voices truly matter ‚Äî especially those speaking in multiple languages.
Because language goes beyond mere accuracy ‚Äî it encompasses lived experience.
And because these insights deserved to be documented.

#### **‚ÄúWhile others were experimenting, my input was impactful.‚Äù** 
As more than just a test subject, my interactions directly shaped the environment of the experiment itself.
This portfolio showcases real-time interactions and thoughtful feedback provided to leading LLM systems, where my input was subsequently reflected in the model's live behavior and adjustments to its dialogue tone.
My linguistic input, structural suggestions, and user experience critiques were not only heard ‚Äî they were visibly integrated.
