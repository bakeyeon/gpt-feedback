# Suggestion for Gemini Translation API: Add a Pre-check to Prevent Text Corruption from Same-Language Translation

## Problem Description

In a web application, when a global translation function is executed on a parent element, any child elements that have already been translated are processed again, leading to double translation.

## The Core Issue

This double translation process severely corrupts the meaning and structure of the text. Most critically, this unnecessary translation occurs even when the source and target languages are identical, causing the original text to become distorted.

For example, requesting a translation of an English text to English does not simply return the original text. Instead, it often results in a nonsensical or altered sentence, degrading the source content.

## Suggested Improvement

I propose adding a validation logic within the API to check if the source and target languages are identical before initiating the main translation process.

IF source_language == target_language:

THEN: Skip the translation process and return the original input text.

ELSE:

THEN: Proceed with the translation as usual.

## Expected Benefits

- Ensures Data Integrity: This would prevent the corruption of original text caused by redundant translation.

- Improves API Efficiency: It would reduce wasted resources and could improve response times by avoiding unnecessary computations.

- Enhances Developer Experience: Developers could use the API with greater confidence in its stability and predictability, ensuring the operation is idempotent.
