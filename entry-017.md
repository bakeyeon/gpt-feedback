# Proposal: Internal Learning Community Pilot Program

## 1. Objective

- Foster a self-driven learning culture across the organization.
- Encourage cross-functional knowledge sharing and collaboration.
- Support HR in tracking learning culture and engagement metrics, with the potential for leveraging AI in performance evaluation based on learning participation and growth.
- Inform internal education budget allocation and optimization by identifying areas of high learning engagement and interest.

## 2. Summary

- Weekly book/topic-based discussion sessions.
- Use of internal tools (Slack/Notion) for async dialogue and archiving.
- Small pilot group with potential for wider rollout.
- Exploration of AI tools to analyze discussion content and participation for insights into employee development and performance.

## 3. Expected Outcomes

- Enhanced individual ownership and leadership.
- Broader thinking and creative stimulation beyond job scope.
- Improved HR metrics around learning participation and engagement.
- Potential for AI-driven insights into employee growth trajectories, informing performance evaluations and identifying high-potential individuals.
- Data-driven insights to optimize internal training budgets by aligning resources with employee learning interests and needs.

## 4. HR Collaboration Needs

- Help with initial participant recruitment and program rollout.
- Co-design of relevant culture/learning KPIs, including metrics that can be tracked and analyzed for potential integration with performance evaluation frameworks.
- Support in designing light incentives (e.g., badges, peer feedback rewards).
- Collaboration on exploring and integrating AI tools for analyzing learning community data.
- Discussion on how learning participation and demonstrated growth can be incorporated as a criterion in promotion guidelines.

## 5. Example

- First topic: Purple Cow by Seth Godin.
- Format: Slack-based async discussion + 30-min weekly video call.
- Archive: Shared Notion page with summaries and key insights.
- Potential AI application: Analyzing Slack discussions for key takeaways, identifying areas of critical thinking, and potentially correlating participation with future performance indicators.
- By explicitly mentioning the potential for AI in analyzing the learning community data, you strengthen the connection to performance evaluation and cost optimization.
