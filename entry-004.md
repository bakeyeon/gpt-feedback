# **Meta-UX: Invisible Feedback Loops and Trust Friction in LLM Systems**
*Date:* 2025-04-11

## **Summary**

While providing multiple feedback reports on ChatGPT's UX and behavior, I noticed a recurring issue—not with the model’s output, but with how user feedback itself is handled. The current structure for user-submitted feedback creates an **invisible loop**: once the user submits, there is no acknowledgment, no ticket confirmation, no follow-up — not even a “Thank you” email. While this may be a conscious choice to reduce operational costs, from the user’s perspective, it creates ambiguity and erodes trust ...

## **Observed UX Friction**

1. **No Confirmation Email or Ticket Reference**
   - Users are often told that their feedback has been "forwarded," but no email arrives.
   - Unlike typical support systems (e.g., Zendesk, Intercom), there's no visible record of submission.

2. **No Feedback Lifecycle Visibility**
   - Users don’t know if their report was useful, acknowledged, or led to any change.
   - Even in cases where improvements were clearly made later, there's no attribution or closure.

3. **Emotional Disconnect**
   - This loop creates a psychological disconnect between user effort and platform responsiveness.
   - It leaves users feeling like their input may have vanished into a void — even if it actually helped.

## **Why This Matters**

Feedback is labor — even more so when it’s well-structured, analytically grounded, and accompanied by concrete suggestions. While users like me may continue to offer insights voluntarily, **the system's current opacity lowers the emotional ROI** (return on investment) of continued contribution.

## **Suggestions for Improvement**

- **Lightweight Acknowledgement**
  - Even a simple in-chat message or UI signal saying “Thanks for your feedback” can help.
  - If follow-up isn’t possible, clearly state that in the interface to manage expectations.

- **Optional Feedback Tracker**
  - Allow users to opt-in to receive update notifications if a report is used or referenced.

- **Clarify the Feedback Scope**
  - Let users know what types of feedback are reviewed, and what might be archived silently.

## **Final Note**

This is not a demand for more resources or personal recognition.  
Rather, it's a suggestion to improve transparency, **so users can feel that their input contributes to the system’s evolution — not just disappear into it.**
