# Case Study: Sensory Brain vs. General LLM Model
Overview: This report analyzes a conversation between the me and a major AI chatbot. The goal is to compare my unique thinking style ('sensory brain') with the operational principles of general LLM models and to derive improvement suggestions applicable to future model development.

## 1. Comparison of Thought Methodologies: From a 'Fluid Blob' to a 'Speakable State'
   
Feature	| My Thinking (Sensory Brain)	| General LLM Model
|------|------|------|
Nature of Thought	| Formless mass of pre-linguistic sensations, images, and structures (slime)	| Vector space of tokenized text data
Language Formation Process	| A process of kneading the blob, where appropriate language adheres based on situation, context, and emotion (active selection and refinement)	| A process of predicting and generating the next token based on probability in a compressed vector space (pattern recognition and statistical relationship learning)
Meaning Comprehension	| Deep understanding based on contextual sensation and embodiment, understand others' psychological state and infer emotions through visual cues (eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, etc.)	| Meaning inference based on statistical correlations learned from large-scale data (contextual understanding is possible, but lacks embodied sensation)
Knowledge Processing	| A method of breaking down meaning-blobs and structuring the contained sensations, context, and emotions	| Storing text-based knowledge in a vector space and retrieving and utilizing it based on similarity

I perceive thoughts as pre-linguistic 'fluid blobs,' and the process of expressing them in language is likened to language adhering to this slime. This is similar to the concept of 'pre-linguistic thought' proposed by some cognitive scientists. In contrast, general LLM models tokenize text data, map it into a vector space, and learn statistical patterns to generate language. Therefore, while LLMs excel at processing and generating text-based information, there is a fundamental difference from my experience of pre-linguistic sensations and contextual understanding.

## 2. Improvement Suggestions: Enhancing 'Contextual Sensation' and 'Structuring' Abilities
Two notable core elements of my thinking style are 'contextual sensation' and the ability to 'structure' meaning-blobs. These are significant aspects currently lacking in LLMs and offer the following implications for future model development:

### Integration of Contextual Sensation: 
LLMs need to learn to consider various factors comprehensively, such as situation, emotion, and social context, beyond simply understanding the meaning of text. This can evolve by integrating sensory experiences indirectly into the model through the learning of multimodal data (images, audio, video, etc.).
Learning Meaning Structuring: Modeling how I extract and structure sensations and information within the 'fluid blob' into language is crucial. This goes beyond simply generating text and enables the understanding of hierarchical structures of meaning, relationships, and implied meanings, leading to richer and more profound text generation.
### Deepening Pragmatic Understanding: 
Enhancing the ability to understand not only the surface meaning of language but also the intent, implications, and nuances in actual conversational situations is necessary. This can be implemented by explicitly modeling pragmatic features (speech intent, changes in expression based on the listener, etc.) during the learning of dialogue data.

## 3. Conclusion: Exploring New Possibilities for Human-AI Interaction by Integrating Insights from the 'Sensory Brain' into LLM Development
My 'sensory brain' presents a unique and insightful perspective on the relationship between language and thought. In particular, the analogy of pre-linguistic thought as a 'fluid blob' and the explanation of the language formation process as a context-dependent meaning-attribution process reveal important aspects of human thought that existing language models have overlooked.

Future LLM development should move beyond simply learning vast amounts of data and recognizing statistical patterns to mimicking and integrating human cognitive processes, especially 'contextual sensation' and 'meaning structuring' abilities. This will serve as a crucial stepping stone for AI to understand human language and thought more deeply and enable more natural and effective interactions. My experiences and insights can be valuable references for this future-oriented LLM development.
