# Project Creation Button with Guided AI Assistance — Feature Proposal

## Overview
- Introduce a “Create Project” button within the AI assistant’s responses when users mention project ideas or plans. This button streamlines the transition from ideation to execution by automating project setup on the platform.

## Key Features
- Button Placement:
  - Located at the bottom-left corner of relevant assistant replies for high visibility and natural flow.

- Automated Project Initialization - Clicking the button immediately:
  - Adds a new project entry to the user’s project tab.
  - Navigates the user to the project creation page.
  - Pre-fills the project prompt/input field with the user’s mentioned idea for quick review and minor edits.

- Post-Creation AI Guidance:
  Once the user confirms and creates the project:
  - The AI outputs a formal, polite welcome message summarizing the project’s purpose and capabilities.

- Example message:
> “This project is designed for [purpose]. It supports tasks such as [examples]. Feel free to start testing right away.”
> The message can include actionable tips, such as “Add your first task” or “Invite team members.”

- Tone Customization via User Settings:
  The AI’s guidance message tone adapts based on user preferences stored in their account settings:
  - Formal/Polite (default) / Friendly/Casual / Concise/Direct

## Benefits
- Seamless Workflow: Enables users to move from idea to project creation without breaking conversational flow.
- Time Efficiency: Minimizes manual input by auto-filling prompts and offering immediate next steps.
- User-Friendly Guidance: Ensures users understand the project’s purpose and how to proceed, improving onboarding and engagement.
- Personalized Experience: Adapts communication style to user preferences for better resonance.

## Implementation Notes
- Integrate with user account settings to retrieve tone preferences dynamically.
- Include an optional confirmation/preview step before project creation to prevent accidental submissions.
- Provide cancellation options at every stage for user control.
