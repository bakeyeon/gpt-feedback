# üß© UX Feedback Report ‚Äì Session Error Context Misalignment

### 1. Overview

During a multi-turn conversation, the assistant responded to a user query containing the phrase ‚Äúsession error‚Äù with a generic troubleshooting guide. While technically accurate, this response was contextually inappropriate. The user was clearly referring to a disruption in conversation continuity, not to a technical browser or login session timeout.

### 2. Key UX Issue

**Mismatch Between Keyword Trigger and Conversational Context**

- The term "session error" is likely mapped to a static output pattern, overriding recent conversational context.
- This caused a jarring break in the interaction flow and a comedic, but unproductive, moment for the user.

--

### 3. Recommendation

**Modify Response Hierarchy and Context Awareness Logic**

- **Primary Recommendation:** When a user mentions "session error," first **check for recent incomplete or repeated user queries.**
- **Fallback Plan:** If no relevant prior context is found, then **default to standard session error troubleshooting tips.**

### 4. Suggested UX Improvement

Implement a **"contextual re-execution + minimal footer note"** model:
```
[Re-perform previous user command, if identifiable]

‚Äî

Note: It seems there may have been a session interruption. If the issue persists technically, please refresh or re-authenticate.
```
This would preserve conversational flow while still covering for actual technical errors in edge cases.
