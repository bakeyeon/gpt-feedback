# Title-Only Recognition Systems to Encourage Quality Feedback

# **Date:** 2025-04-11

---

## **Summary**

This document proposes a low-cost, high-impact strategy to encourage consistent, high-quality feedback from engaged users of ChatGPT and other OpenAI products. Inspired by programs such as Adobe‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Student‚Äù recognition and Microsoft‚Äôs MVP initiative (albeit with zero operational cost), this suggestion centers around offering **a symbolic title or badge** to recurring, thoughtful contributors ‚Äî without any obligations or formal relationship.

---

## **Observed Problem**

Currently, feedback submission channels such as [help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com/) or in-app reports:

- Offer **no confirmation**, **no status visibility**, and **no feedback loop** to the user.
- Leave active contributors uncertain if their input has been received or useful.
- Risk reducing future contributions from thoughtful users due to lack of visible appreciation or acknowledgment.

Moreover, the process lacks a structured way to **recognize or retain quality contributors** without formal employment.

## **Proposal: MVP-style Recognition Without Cost or Commitment**

### üéØ What is proposed:

- A **non-operational, symbolic recognition** system (e.g., "Community Reviewer", "Power User", or "ChatGPT Insight Contributor")
- Visible only on user profile (if opted-in), or optionally in community boards / email footers.
- No expectation of continued activity or output.

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

Benefit |	Explanation
Zero cost |	No reward, no support structure, no backend processing.
High motivation |	Recognition alone is a powerful intrinsic motivator, especially for early adopters or UX-focused contributors.
Reputation leverage |	Users may list this in CVs, portfolios, or LinkedIn ‚Äî indirectly boosting OpenAI‚Äôs brand.
Low risk | No contractual or legal entanglements ‚Äî purely opt-in and symbolic.
Community building |	Potential entry point into future invite-only pilot programs or Slack spaces.

## **Optional Extensions (Not Required)**

- **List page of MVP contributors** (like GitHub Arctic Vault or Figma Community highlights)
- **Light Discord role, Slack tag, or profile badge**
- **Beta testing pool** for UX experiments

Again, none of this is required ‚Äî the core value lies in **title-only, opt-in recognition**.

---

## **Why This Matters**

Product feedback is often underutilized or inconsistent in quality. But when engaged users:

- Take time to format markdown reports
- Observe patterns across systems
- Provide multilingual QA context

... it becomes invaluable. Formalizing this into a lightweight recognition structure could:

- Increase retention of such users
- Encourage others to submit meaningful feedback
- Build a layer of trust and pride in OpenAI‚Äôs user community

---

## **Conclusion**

This proposal is not about expanding programmatic infrastructure. It is about **psychological momentum** ‚Äî the smallest signal that says, ‚Äúwe see you.‚Äù

If OpenAI builds toward a more community-centric feedback ecosystem, this kind of symbolic gesture could be the starting point.
