# Feature Suggestion: Context-Aware Auto-Segmentation of Conversations

## Overview

As a frequent user of modern AI chat assistants, I often find myself discussing multiple topics within a single conversation. Due to the conversation length limit, it's frustrating to manually break topics into separate chats or lose track of where certain discussions took place.

## Problem

Current chat sessions are **linear and manually segmented**. When users naturally shift between different topics (e.g., studying, personal life, app ideas), all content is bundled into one long thread. This results in:

- Disrupted continuity due to session limits  
- Cognitive overload for users trying to track context  
- Increased friction when referencing past conversations  

## Proposed Solution

Introduce a system that **automatically detects and organizes distinct topics** within a single conversation thread. This could take the form of:

- **Auto-tagged topic headers** inside the chat  
- **Side tabs or collapsible sections** per topic  
- A **"Conversation Map"** that visualizes topic clusters  

## Example Use Case

A single session might look like this:

1. "I’m working on the FMVA certification" → categorized under **Finance Learning**  
2. "My cat recently figured out how to open windows" → categorized under **Pet Updates**  
3. "I want to build a journaling app for my mom" → categorized under **App Ideas**  

Each of these could be grouped separately in the UI without requiring users to start new chats.

## Why It Matters

- Improves long-term usability and recall  
- Helps users with complex, multi-threaded thinking styles  
- Bridges the gap between "chatbot" and "second brain"  

## Optional Enhancements

- Allow users to **rename or merge topic sections**  
- Support exporting by topic (for journaling, research, etc.)  
- Make it accessible via keyboard shortcut or setting toggle
